#Welcome to the ShowsAholic app!

Android APP developed for the Distributed Software Platform course A.Y. 2014/2015. 

It connects to the TvRage database, performs XML parsing of the search results and then Web Scraping to achieve the needed data (e.g. Synopsis).

Additional libraries used:
* Volley for Image retrieval and caching
* appcompat-v7 for Material Design compatibility
* jsoup for HTML parsing

A small demo can be seen here:
